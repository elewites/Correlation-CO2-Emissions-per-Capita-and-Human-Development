# Correlation-CO2-Emissions-per-Capita-and-Human-Development

## Abstract
This study aimed to examine the correlation between CO2 emissions per capita and the Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) across 154 countries, with a focus on determining whether the correlation was stronger in developing countries. The study utilized Pearson's correlation test to investigate the relationship between these variables, and the data was divided into four subsets based on the countries' development status: Very High IHDI (>= 0.80), High IHDI (0.70 to 0.79), Medium IHDI (0.55 to 0.69), and Low IHDI (< 0.50). The study found a significant positive correlation globally, with a stronger correlation in developing countries. However, a potentially negative correlation was observed in countries with very high development. These findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders working towards a sustainable future.

## The Data

This repository contains 6 data files. 
1. `co2_vs_ihdi_data_compiled_final.xlsx` has all the compiled data, data subsets, codebook, sources and raw data.
2. `all_countries.csv` contains data for all countries
3. `very_high_ihdi.csv` contains data for countries with Very High IHDI
4. `high_ihdi.csv` contains data for countries with High IHDI
5. `medium_ihdi.csv` contains data for countries with Medium IHDI
6. `low_ihdi.csv` contains data for countries Low IHDI

The data was seperated into subsets to faciliate analysis. CSV Files (2) to (6) are utilized in python script.
